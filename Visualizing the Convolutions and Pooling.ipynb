    "Step 1 is to gather the data. You'll notice that there's a bit of a change here in that the training data needed to be reshaped. That's because the first convolution expects a single tensor containing everything, so instead of 60,000 28x28x1 items in a list, we have a single 4D list that is 60,000x28x28x1, and the same for the test images. If you don't do this, you'll get an error when training as the Convolutions do not recognize the shape."

Without going into too much detail here, the idea is that it creates a 2x2 array of pixels, and picks the biggest one, thus turning 4 pixels into 1. It repeats this across the image, and in so doing halves the number of horizontal, and halves the number of vertical pixels, effectively reducing the image by 25%.\n",
